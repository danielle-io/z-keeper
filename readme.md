This cross platform application created with Ionic allows you to track your sleep, and how you are feeling throughout the day.

If Ionic is not installed on your machine run command npm install -g ionic to install it.
If Angular is not installed on your machine run command npm install -g @angular/cli  to install it.

Run ionic lab to run the project - mobile simulators for iPhone and Android will appear.
